Prolog Implementation in Haskell

I have never coded in Haskell before and thought this would be a good project to try out the language with.

### Things To Do:

- [ ] Add command history and cursor movement to the command line
- [ ] Actually evaluate the rules and queries properly
- [x] Parse OR and AND expressions
